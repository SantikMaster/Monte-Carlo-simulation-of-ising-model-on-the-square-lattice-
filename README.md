# Monte-Carlo-simulation-of-ising-model-on-the-square-lattice-
Monte Carlo simulation of ising model on the square lattice with random interaction and long range interaction

 this program provides alorhythm for 2D ising system using Monte Carlo calculation. As result, you will get the *.txt file which is M(h) if found - the Magnetization as function of external field. In addition you can get a spin configuration for any field or temperature that you want. Then you get file in the format XYAM - XY - are the coordinates of the spin and A- angle M - magnitude


The random interaction (RandCof) and long range interaction (J_d) ~1/r^2 can be included 


The examples of structures you can see in *.jpg file.
